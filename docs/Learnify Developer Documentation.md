The platform ensures that every student always knows **what to study next**, with adaptive recommendations.

---

# **2\. Core Architecture Summary**

* **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), Server Components, Server Actions

* **Database:** Supabase Postgres, RLS Policies

* **Auth:** Supabase Auth (OAuth)

* **Realtime:** Supabase Realtime for topics & dependencies

* **AI:** OpenRouter models for generating DAGs

* **Visualization:** React Flow

* **Analytics:** Custom engine \+ charts

This foundation supports all 8 features.

---

# **3\. Database Schema \+ RLS (Backend Foundation)**

The backend is built on top of key tables:

### **Profiles**

Stores user profile data.

### **Subjects**

Represents major study areas created by users.

### **Topics**

Each topic belongs to a subject and contains SM‑2 metadata.

### **Topic Dependencies**

Edges forming the knowledge graph.

### **Study Logs**

Records learning & review sessions.

### **Saved Graph Layouts**

(Optional) stores user graph positions.

### **Shared Subject Clones**

(Optional) for community sharing imports.

**Realtime Requirements:**

* `topics` → REQUIRED

* `topic_dependencies` → REQUIRED

* `study_logs` → optional

All RLS policies ensure only owners can modify data.

---

# **4\. Complete Feature Explanations**

Below is a complete breakdown of how every Learnify feature works from a developer perspective.

---

# **Feature 1 — Subject & Topic Management**

### **Purpose:**

Foundation of the entire system.

### **What Users Do:**

* Create subjects

* Add topics manually or via AI

* Edit/delete topics

* Manage metadata

### **What Developers Implement:**

* CRUD UI \+ Server Actions

* Pages under `/subjects`

* Default topic status \= `locked`

Topics become the nodes used by all other features.

---

# **Feature 2 — Knowledge Graph & Unlocking Engine**

### **Purpose:**

Controls topic progression.

### **Knowledge Graph:**

* Stored in `topic_dependencies`

* Forms a DAG of prerequisites

### **Unlocking Engine Workflow:**

1. Fetch locked topics

2. Check if all parents are mastered/reviewing

3. Unlock topics by setting `status = available`

### **Developer Tasks:**

* Implement `updateUnlockedTopics()`

* Call unlocking logic:

  * after reviewing a topic

  * after generating an AI graph

  * on subject dashboard load

This engine ensures "What to Study Next" works correctly.

---

# **Feature 3 — Learning & Review System (SM‑2)**

### **Purpose:**

Ensures long‑term retention via spaced repetition.

### **Learning Session:**

* Topic becomes `learning`

### **Review Session:**

Uses SM‑2 algorithm:

* User rates recall 0–5

* Algorithm computes next review interval, repetition, EF

### **Developer Tasks:**

* Implement `/learn/[topicId]` page

* Implement `/review/[topicId]` page

* Update DB fields:

  * `interval_days`

  * `repetition_count`

  * `difficulty_factor`

  * `next_review_at`

  * `status`

* Insert logs into `study_logs`

Review outcomes feed back into unlocking.

---

# **Feature 4 — AI Graph Generation (Dependency DAG)**

### **Purpose:**

Automatically generate a full structured roadmap using AI.

### **Process:**

1. User clicks "Generate Study Flow"

2. System calls model with curated prompt

3. Model returns JSON:

   * topics

   * dependencies

4. Insert topics into DB

5. Insert dependencies

6. Trigger unlocking engine

### **Developer Tasks:**

* `/api/generate-graph` route

* JSON parser \+ insert logic

* Slug → UUID mapping

* Call unlocking immediately

This feature provides instant learning structures.

---

# **Feature 5 — Knowledge Graph Visualizer**

### **Purpose:**

Interactive DAG showing the entire subject structure.

### **How it Works:**

1. Fetch topics \+ dependencies

2. Convert to React Flow nodes/edges

3. Color-code nodes by status

4. Allow click navigation

### **Developer Tasks:**

* Build `GraphCanvas` using React Flow

* Create `NodeRenderer` \+ `EdgeRenderer`

* (Optional) Save positions to DB

Visualization makes learning intuitive.

---

# **Feature 6 — Dashboard & Recommendation Widget**

### **Global Dashboard:**

Shows all subjects with basic progress.

### **Subject Dashboard:**

Shows learning intelligence:

* Unlock engine run

* Recommendations (due reviews → available topics)

* Mini graph preview

* Analytics cards

### **Developer Tasks:**

* `/dashboard` page

* `/dashboard/[subjectId]` page

* Recommendation algorithm implementation

Dashboard is where all engine outputs appear.

---

# **Feature 7 — Analytics System**

### **Purpose:**

Visual insights into learning performance.

### **Analytics Types:**

* Study time (weekly)

* Weak topics (low avg performance)

* Subject progress

* Upcoming reviews

* Dependency depth analysis

### **Developer Tasks:**

* Build backend analytics queries

* Build charts:

  * Study time

  * Donut chart for statuses

  * Heatmap for review schedule

Analytics elevate the user experience significantly.

---

# **Feature 8 — Community Sharing**

### **Purpose:**

Allow users to publish roadmaps publicly.

### **How it Works:**

* Add `is_public` column

* Toggle visibility in subject dashboard

* Public route:  
   `/u/[username]/subjects/[subjectId]`

* Viewer sees:

  * readonly graph

  * readonly topics

  * readonly analytics summary

### **Developer Tasks:**

* Add public RLS rule

* Build public viewer UI

* Allow roadmaps to be cloned

This feature enables viral sharing and community growth.

### **7\. User shares roadmap**

→ Feature 8

Everything is interconnected.

# **6\. Learnify File Structure (Implementation Blueprint)**

Full Next.js 15 structure with feature‑aligned directories:

* `/dashboard` — dashboards

* `/subjects` — subject/topic management

* `/learn`, `/review` — study flows

* `/api/generate-graph` — AI integration

* `/u/[username]/subjects` — community sharing

* `lib/graph` — unlock engine, recommendation system

* `lib/sm2` — spaced repetition

* `lib/analytics` — reporting

* `components/graph` — visualizer

This file structure ensures clean separation of concerns.
